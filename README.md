# Landing Page Project

## About

This landing page was created as a way to practice HTML and CSS basics while taking [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

You can view the finished project [here](https://lucieyarish.github.io/odin-landing-page/)!

Assignment instructions can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The [design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) of this web page was provided by The Oding Project. The HTML & CSS is entirely my work.

The photo used in this project was taken by Christina Morillo and downloaded from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-using-silver-macbook-pro-1181467/).

## Limitations

- The landing page isn't responsive (yet).
- It could be more pixel-perfect.
